# ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Project

The goal of the NetMaze Azure Hybrid Networking Project is to design and deploy a secure interconnected network environment in Azure that simulates hybrid connectivity between on-premises and cloud resources ensuring safe data transfer, controlled access and communication across virtual networks.

# ðŸ§© Objective

- Connect separate Azure networks (VNets) securely over the internet using VPN Gateway.

- Enable remote management without exposing public IPs through Azure Bastion.

- Securely access Azure PaaS services (Azure SQL Database) via Private Endpoints instead of public endpoints.

- Implement high availability using a Load Balancer to distribute traffic between backend VMs.

- Enforce segmentation and security with Network Security Groups (NSGs).

# ðŸ§  Key Azure Services used

- Azure Virtual Networking (VNets, Subnets, Route Tables)

- Azure VPN Gateway configuration and site-to-site connectivity

- Azure Bastion for secure RDP/SSH access

- Azure Load Balancer (backend pools, probes, and rules)

- Azure Private Link and Private Endpoints

- Network Security Groups (NSG rules and segmentation)

- Azure DNS (private dns zones)

# ðŸ’¡ Soft Skills:

- Problem-solving and troubleshooting connectivity issues

- Logical network design and documentation

- Attention to detail in configuration and validation

# ðŸ”§ Tools

- Microsoft Azure Portal

- PowerShell / Azure CLI

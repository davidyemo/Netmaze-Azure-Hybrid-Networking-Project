# Netmaze-Azure-Hybrid-Networking-Project
NetMaze Hybrid Networking Project — An end-to-end Azure projectthat builds a segmented VNet, secures admin access with Bastion, exposes Azure SQL via Private Link, balances web traffic with an internal Load Balancer, and connects to a simulated on-prem VNet using a site-to-site VPN. Includes NSGs, Private DNS, and validation screenshots.

# What was the aim of the project?

To build a secure, realistic hybrid Azure network that segments workloads, exposes apps privately, and connects a “cloud” VNet to a simulated on-prem VNet over a site-to-site VPN—then prove it works end-to-end.
